------- Instructions:

Extract the folder "NPC Tuning" to your Modloader folder.

-- Download the latest version of Modloader: MixMods.com.br/2015/01/SA-Modloader.html

-- REQUIRES CLEO+: MixMods.com.br/2020/03/CLEOPlus.html


= Rarity:
It is a little rare to see them (lowriders are relatively common).
You can adjust the rarity in "NPC Tuning.ini".

= If any car has a problem:
The mod avoids crash in cars with poorly adapted and configured tuning, but it is good to always have them well configured.
If any mod car has caused bugs or crashes, contact the car's author.
Remembering that the carmods line, for example:
car_name, nto_b_l, nto_b_s, nto_b_tw
Removes all the tuning of a given car, keeping only nitro and wheels. Just place the line in a .txt in a modloader folder.


Version: v1.0.1
